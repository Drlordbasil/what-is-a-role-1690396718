Certainly! Please share the Python script with me so I can help you optimize it.

```python


def calculate_sum(a, b):
    result = 0
    for i in range(a, b+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += i
    return result


x = 1
y = 10
sum_of_evens = calculate_sum(x, y)
print(sum_of_evens)
```

I will proceed with the optimization.
